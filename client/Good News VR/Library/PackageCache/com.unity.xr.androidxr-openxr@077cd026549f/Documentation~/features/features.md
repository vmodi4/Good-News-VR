# Features

This package implements a set of AR Foundation features and also interfaces with additional OpenXR features from other XR packages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use any feature in this package, you must enable the corresponding OpenXR Feature in the **Android XR** feature group. Otherwise, your app can't access these features. Refer to [Project setup](xref:androidxr-openxr-project-setup) to understand how to enable Unity OpenXR: Android XR features.
