# Application SpaceWarp

Application SpaceWarp is an optimization for OpenXR that helps applications maintain a high frame rate. SpaceWarp synthesizes every other frame, which can reduce computational power and energy use considerably. The technique uses reprojection when synthesizing frames to reduce latency between the userâ€™s movements and display updates.

Refer to [URP Application SpaceWarp](xref:um-xr-application-spacewarp) for more details on how to use SpaceWarp.

To enable this feature in a Unity project, you need the following:

* Unity 6000.1.13f1 or newer
* OpenXR 1.15.1 or newer
* Universal Render Pipeline (URP)

Refer to [Enable and use Application SpaceWarp](xref:openxr-spacewarp-workflow) for more information on how to setup SpaceWarp in your project using OpenXR.

## SpaceWarp setup

To enable SpaceWarp in your Android XR project:

1. Open the **Project Settings** window in the Unity Editor (menu: **Edit > Project Settings**).
2. Select the **XR Plug-in Management** section.
3. Choose the tab at the top corresponding to your current XR device.
4. Enable the **OpenXR** checkbox, then enable the **Android XR feature group** checkbox.

5. Underneath **XR Plug-in Management**, select **OpenXR**.
6. In the list of **OpenXR Feature Groups**, select **All Features**.
7. In the list of features, enable **Application SpaceWarp**.
8. Click the gear icon (<span class="icon-Core-Settings" aria-label="Settings"></span>) for **Application SpaceWarp** to open its configuration window.
9. Enable **Use Right Handed NDC**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SpaceWarp motion vectors on Android XR devices use right-handed normalized device coordinates (NDC). You must enable the **Use Right Handed NDC** option on the **Application SpaceWarp** configuration. If this option is set incorrectly, the motion vectors will point in the wrong direction and result in erroneous warp calculations. The right-handed NDC option is only supported in Unity 6000.1.13f1+ and OpenXR 1.15.1+.
